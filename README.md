# 🚘 VinCertBot

A Telegram bot for quick and convenient checking of vehicle history using Ukrainian databases. The bot aggregates data from open sources and generates a clear, easy-to-read report with specifications, mileage, registration history, and wanted/stolen status.

## 🌟 Features

* **Smart Search:** Supports searching by both a 17-character VIN code and a state license plate (e.g., `AA1234BC`).
* **Cascade System (Fallback):** If data is missing on one platform (e.g., the car was never sold online), the bot automatically and seamlessly switches to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) database.
* **Bilingual Support:** Automatically detects the user's Telegram app language and responds in Ukrainian (`uk`) or Russian (`ru`).
* **Deep Parsing:** Extracts not only the make and year but also the color, fuel type, and engine capacity directly from the registration history.
* **Asynchronous:** Built with modern `aiogram 3` and `aiohttp` libraries, ensuring fast performance without blocking the thread during multiple simultaneous requests.
